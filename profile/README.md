Argo is a student run robotics team of the [University of Belgrade](https://www.bg.ac.rs/home/), Serbia.
Even though we're a technical team, we have members from most major schools in Belgrade. We have one simple goal, and that is to make engineers.

Find out more about us on our [website](https://www.argorobotics.rs), or if you have any questions, reach out via email at [contact@argorobotics.rs](mailto:contact@argorobotics.rs).
